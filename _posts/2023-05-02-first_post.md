Hi everyone, this is the new version of my website. I wil try to update it with some explanations and figures about my on going work, such as code I develop or science projects I am working on. 

For example, right now, I am working on the development of an ice damage model in the ice to simulate the effect of crevasses and other damaged structures on the flow of ice.
