<h1>Hi there, I'm Cyrille Mosbeux</h1>
<p>
I am a glacilogist. More specifically, I use and develop numerical models to simulate the current state of ice sheets and project their future evolution.
During my PhD in Grenoble (France), I worked on developing techniques to improve the representation of ice sheet and
glacier basal conditions, using the Finite Element model <a href="http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/">Elmer/Ice</a>
(an add-on package to Elmer, which is a multi-physics FEM suite mainly developed by CSC-IT in Finland).
</p>
<p>
I then moved to San Diego (California) to continue my research at the Scripps Instituion of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.
There, I have been using Elmer/Ice to help understanding the physical processes underlying ice shelf bending we observe close to the front of Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica, and leading to small calving events.
I also study the potential causes of seasonal variability in ice flow observed at different GPS stations on Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.
</p>
<p>
I am currently back in France, at <a href="https://www.ige-grenoble.fr/">IGE</a>, where I work on the coupling of Elmer/Ice with the ocean model
      <a href="https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/">NEMO</a> to realize projection ice mass loss in the Amundsen Sea region in Antarctica.
