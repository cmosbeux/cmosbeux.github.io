<h1>Hi there, I'm Cyrille Mosbeux</h1>
<p>
I am a glacilogist. More specifically, I use and develop numerical models to simulate the current state of ice sheets and project their future evolution.
During my PhD in Grenoble (France), I worked on developing techniques to improve the representation of ice sheet and
glacier basal conditions, using the Finite Element model <a href="http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/">Elmer/Ice</a>
(an add-on package to Elmer, which is a multi-physics FEM suite mainly developed by CSC-IT in Finland).
</p>
<p>
I then moved to San Diego (California) to continue my research at the Scripps Instituion of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.
There, I have been using Elmer/Ice to help understanding the physical processes underlying ice shelf bending we observe close to the front of Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica, and leading to small calving events.
I also study the potential causes of seasonal variability in ice flow observed at different GPS stations on Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.
</p>
<p>
I am currently back in France, at <a href="https://www.ige-grenoble.fr/">IGE</a>, where I work on the coupling of Elmer/Ice with the ocean model
      <a href="https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/">NEMO</a> to realize projection ice mass loss in the Amundsen Sea region in Antarctica. I also work on the modeling of damage evolution in ice sheet models, using Stokes (viscous fluid) mechanics in combination with principles of Continuous Damage Mechanics. The idea is that, under large extensional stress, the ice can fracture, leading to the opening of crevasses. These crevasses tend to reduce the apparent viscosity and the resistance of ice. Our goal is to simulate this loss of mechanical resistance and loss of fluidity in Stokes flow models.
